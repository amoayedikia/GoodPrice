# GoodPrice_front

GoodPrice is a project defined to help users find the cheapest suppliers. Services like Google Shopping crawl the web to index items for sale that are listed on various online retails (e.g., eBay, Amazon or personal shopping websotes). If a supplier does not have a website to sale their stuff, then buyers may not be able to find it. Besides, a supplier with no online inventory might not be able to compete with other suppliers. 

Hence, GoodPrice provides a platform for all suppliers to share their items and compete on price with other suppliers. In addition, buyers can look for an item to find the cheapest supplier.

This is not an online shopping website. Therefore, no pyaments and purchases can be done through the website. 
However, GoodPrice allows suppliers and buyers to get connected through sending messages on the platform.

This repository contains the frontend and some small features of the project.
